## Components
Each component must include three files, plus an two optional files:

1. A `.haml` file containing the markup for the component (see the [Haml homepage](http://haml.info) or other comonents' `.haml` files if you are unfamiliar with the syntax) `src/components/your-component/your-component.haml`.

2. A `.scss` files containing the styles for the component (see the [Sass homepage](http://sass-lang.com) or other comonents' `.scss` files if you are unfamiliar with the syntax) at `src/components/your-component/your-component.scss`.

3. Another `.haml` file for the documentation of the API for that comonent. It should include all public-facing methods (if your component includes `javascript`) and an example of the HTML and CSS markup for that component (this piece is automatically generated for you, so you just have to include any clarification, usage examples, etc).

4. (optional) A `.coffee` file for the javascript required for your component (see the [CoffeeScript homepage](http://coffeescript.org) or other components' `.coffee` files if you are unfamiliar with the syntax) at `src/components/your-component/your-component.coffee`. See section "CoffeeScript" below for details on the coding style for javascript components.

5. (optional) If you include a `.coffee` file in your component, make sure to also include a test suite to cover the major features of that component. This should be done using the Jasmine testing framework (see the [Jasmine homepage](http://jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction.html) if you are unfamiliar with the syntax). The main test file should be at `spec/your-component-spec.coffee`. You may also wish to include a Helper for that spec, which should be written in CoffeeScript and included at `spec/helpers/your-component-spec-helpers.coffee`, and a Fixture, which should be written in HTML and included at `spec/fixtures/your-component-spec-fixture.html`.

All component names should be in lowercase with hyphens (no underscores or camelcase). The top level HTML class name for the component should correspond to the component name. All of the above components can be automatically generated by running `ruby bin/new_component.rb component-name` from the root directory of the project.

If a `coffeescript` file is included as part of your component, the class names should be the camelcase version of your component name; if the component includes some sort of controller, the class name should be `ComponentNameController`. For example, the `toggle-switch` component has two `coffeescript` classes: `ToggleSwitch` (to represent a single component) and `ToggleSwitchController` (to represent the controller of all such components on a page). See below for more details on the expectations for `coffeescript` components.

### CoffeeScript
TODO
See the other `coffeescript` component files for more examples of how the components should be structured.
